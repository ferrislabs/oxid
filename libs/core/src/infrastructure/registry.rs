//! Repository registry: maps a (domain, backend) pair to a concrete repository
//! implementation. Each `Pg*Repository` declares its membership via
//! `#[oxid_macros::repository(domain = X, backend = Postgres)]`, which expands
//! to a [`RepoFor`] impl. Use-case macros resolve the right type by querying
//! `<Backend as RepoFor<Domain>>::Repo`, so swapping the active backend is a
//! single-line change ([`Backend`] alias below).
